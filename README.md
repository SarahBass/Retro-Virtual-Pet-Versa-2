## DESCRIPTION:
Earn steps to power up your very own Pixel Pet!

Retro Pixel Pet is based on the old-school 'virtual pet' craze of the 90's. Retro Pixel Pet Puppy starts as an egg, hatches, evolves, and finally grows into a cute digital monster. When you reach your step goal, your pet will be fully transformed! Look at the heart meter to keep track of your progress. Clean up after your pet by shaking your wrist. The cleaner the pet, the nicer its final form will be!

This is a free clockface only, and it is not the full game. The buttons and games are not activated for this free BETA version of the clockface. Background color changes daily. When you click the buttons, the screen displays the time, date, and all of your daily statistics. Checking your screen gives the pet rest, and earns it bonus points.

Pixel Pets are All Original Designs
